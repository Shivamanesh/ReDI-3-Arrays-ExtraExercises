1.Find all elements less than X
Write a program to find all elements of the array of ints that are less than X


2.Build Sum element
Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a Sum Array sum[] (of same size) such
that sum[i]is equal to the sum of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i].


3.Create an Array from the terminal
Add elements to the array from the terminal until the user enters nothing


4.Square matrix calculations
Write user defined methods for square matrix to calculate:

Left diagonal sum
Right diagonal sum


5.Swap two elements
Write a Java program of swap two elements in an array list. User enters the positions.
Check user’s inout, that positions are valid


6.Organizing array
Given an array arr[] of random integers, the task is to push all the zero’s in the
array to the start and all the one’s to the end of the array. Note that the order
of all the other elements should be the same.

Example:

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0} Output: 0 0 0 2 4 3 5 1



7.Check if it is a subset array
Given two arrays and we need to find whether one array is a subset of other or not

Example: Input: array1: 1 6 5 array2: 1 4 7 3 5 6

output: yes
